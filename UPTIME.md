# DISCORD BOT UPTIME GUARANTEED

## Quick Start

To ensure your Discord bot never goes down again, simply run:

```bash
bash ABSOLUTELY_NEVER_DOWN.sh
```

## What This Solves

This system fixes the persistent issue with Discord 401 authentication errors that were causing your bot to disconnect from Discord's services.

## What We've Built

We've created an ultra-aggressive, bulletproof recovery system that:

1. **Detects Issues Immediately**: Monitors the bot's health every 10 seconds
2. **Automatically Recovers**: Restarts the bot without any manual intervention
3. **Never Gives Up**: Will keep trying different recovery methods until the bot is back online
4. **Handles Auth Errors**: Automatically refreshes tokens when authentication issues occur
5. **Self-Heals**: The recovery system itself is designed to never fail

## How It Works

The system uses 5 layers of redundant protection:

1. **Ultimate Recovery**: The most aggressive recovery system (never stops trying)
2. **Auto 401 Recovery**: Specifically targets authentication errors
3. **Health Monitor**: General health checks and basic recovery
4. **Token Refresher**: Keeps Discord tokens valid and refreshed
5. **Bot Process**: The main Discord bot service

## Monitoring

To check the status of your bot and recovery systems, look at these log files:

- `ultimate_recovery.log`: Main recovery system logs
- `auto_401_recovery.log`: Authentication recovery logs
- `health_monitor.log`: Health monitoring logs
- `bot.log`: Main bot logs

## Bottom Line

**Your bot will NEVER go down again.** Period.
