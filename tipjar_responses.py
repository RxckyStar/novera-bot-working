    "🏝️ ISLAND ACQUISITION FINALIZED! That's right, darlings—Mommy just purchased a PRIVATE ISLAND with the accumulated value deductions from this season alone! Named it 'Failure Atoll'—has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Building a luxury resort with rooms named after each player who contributed over 100 million in value reductions! The presidential suite is called 'The Rage Quit Villa' in honor of our most emotionally unstable player!
